# LeetCode-Solutions
"My solutions to LeetCode problems, focusing on Data Structures and Algorithms."

# 🚀 LeetCode & Data Structures Journey

Welcome to my algorithm problem-solving repository! This space is dedicated to my daily practice with Data Structures and Algorithms, primarily focusing on the **LeetCode 75** study plan.

## 🎯 Goals
- Strengthen foundational knowledge in Data Structures (Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, etc.).
- Improve problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking.
- Keep a consistent daily coding habit.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
Solutions are primarily implemented in:
- **C** (For deep understanding of memory management, pointers, and core data structures)
- **Python / Java** (For rapid prototyping and specific use cases)

## 📁 Repository Structure
Problems are categorized by their core data structure or algorithm technique. Every solution file includes Time and Space complexity analysis.
